# Manage admins on Meraki Dashboard (NodeJS Edition)

This script is from the Github of Meraki, but ChatGPT translate it for us...

Link : https://github.com/meraki/automation-scripts/blob/master/manageadmins.py

I added the option to update the permission for an admin, cause it was not available in the Meraki's Repo.
